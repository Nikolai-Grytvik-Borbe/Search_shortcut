# Universal Search Bar Shortcut

## Description
The Universal Search Bar Shortcut Chrome extension allows users to activate the search bar on any website using a consistent keyboard shortcut. This extension improves browsing efficiency by standardizing one of the most common web navigation actions.

## Features
- **Universal Shortcut**: Use a single, customizable keyboard shortcut to focus on the search bar across different websites.
- **Customizable Hotkeys**: Easily configure your preferred keyboard shortcut via the extension settings.

## Installation
1. Download the extension file from the [Releases page](#).
2. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`.
3. Enable "Developer mode" at the top right.
4. Click "Load unpacked" and select the downloaded extension directory.

## Usage
After installation, simply press the configured keyboard shortcut (default is `Ctrl+Shift+F`) to focus on the search bar on any supported website.

## Customizing the Shortcut
To change the default keyboard shortcut:
1. Navigate to the extension's options page.
2. Enter your new shortcut key combination.
3. Save your changes.

## Supported Websites
The extension works automatically with most popular websites. If a site is not supported, please [file an issue](#).

## To-Do
- **Expand Website Compatibility**: Some websites may not yet be supported for automatic search bar selection. We are actively working to increase the number of supported websites.
- **Improve Universal Selection**: Investigate and implement a more universal method to reliably select search bars across different website structures.
