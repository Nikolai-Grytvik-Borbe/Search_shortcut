# Universal Search Bar Shortcut

## Description
The Universal Search Bar Shortcut Chrome extension allows users to activate the search bar on any website using a consistent keyboard shortcut. This extension improves browsing efficiency by standardizing one of the most common web navigation actions.

## Features
- **Universal Shortcut**: Use a single, customizable keyboard shortcut to focus on the search bar across different websites.

## Installation (Add this when the extension has been accepted)
1. Download the extension file from the [Releases page](#).
2. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`.
3. Enable "Developer mode" at the top right.
4. Click "Load unpacked" and select the downloaded extension directory.

## Usage
After installation, simply press the configured keyboard shortcut (default is `Shift`) to focus on the search bar on any supported website.

## [Supported Websites](./manifest.json)
The extension works automatically with most popular websites. If a site is not supported, please [file an issue](https://github.com/Nikolai-Grytvik-Borbe/Search_shortcut/issues).

## To-Do
- [ ] **Expand Website Compatibility**: Some websites may not yet be supported for automatic search bar selection. We are actively working to increase the number of supported websites.
- [ ] **Improve Universal Selection**: Investigate and implement a more universal method to reliably select search bars across different website structures.
- [ ] **Customizable Hotkeys**: Easily configure your preferred keyboard shortcut via the extension settings.
